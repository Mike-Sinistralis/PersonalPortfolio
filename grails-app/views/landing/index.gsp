    Full Stack Developer and Video Game Enthusiast

    My name is Michael Zimmerman, and I enjoy developing on the web. Front-end, Back-end, and all the services in between, I like putting the pieces together. I reside in Youngstown, OH. By day I work at developing audience response software, and at night I jump between my two loves of web development and gaming. My hobby is working towards combining my loves.
